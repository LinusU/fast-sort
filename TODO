RELEASE REQUIREMENTS:

☐ Name default exported sort function
☐ Better documentation for natural sort
☐ Check about natural sort improving (instance that do natural sort by default)
☐ should we rename customComparerProvider to e.g customComparerHandler (add comments for it)
✔ Shoud remove 2 almost indentical erros ("Invalid 'by' sorting") @done(19-12-04 16:09)
☐ Check about using object resolver instead if in getMultiPropertySorter e.g sortDefinition[type] || multiPropObjectSorter, (pros/const)
☐ Initial buidl minified 1.93KB (Check can we make it lower) (after build update droped to 1.54 kb)
☐ Add TS specific linter rules as e.g (no space betwene type). check regarding other linter rules
☐ Add proper interface for comparer
☐ Enable eslint in TS files
☐ Rename flock naming in benchmarks to fast-sort
☐ Examples in multiPropStringSorter and multiPropObjectSorter are wrong
☐ We should also have tests for builds not just source code before publishing
☐ Update depndendcy versions in benchmarks and run tbenchamrk reuslts again
☐ sort.by('name') is now valid or sort.by() so make sure to cover those new possibilities in tests
☐ now we can do something as  sort.asc({ desc: 'aaa' }) which sorts in desc order. Is there a reason to guard against that?? There should not be a reason to complicate a code fo that
☐ How correct is (valA == null && valB == null) in multiPropEqualityHandler if we are going to use custom comparer??


NICE TO DO FOR PHASE 2:

☐ Improve interfaces (so we don't have any in them as e.g for comparer)
